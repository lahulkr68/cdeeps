# \# CDEEPS

# 

# Config Driven Enterprise Event Publishing System

# 

# \## Problem Statement

# In large enterprise systems, not every business operation should publish an event.

# CDEEPS allows events to be published only if configured, ensuring flexibility,

# scalability, and controlled event flow.

# 

# \## Features (Planned)

# \- Event creation

# \- Config-based event enablement

# \- Event persistence

# \- Event publishing (Kafka / REST)

# \- Retry \& DLQ handling

# 

# \## Tech Stack

# \- C++

# \- STL

# \- JSON (planned)

# \- Kafka (conceptual integration)

# 

# \## Current Status

# \- Event model created

# \- Event processor skeleton implemented

#
